When I'm investigating portability problems in PostgreSQL, I would like to be
able to spin up a virtual machine that already has a complete working
environment (packages, any necessary sysctl changes, PostgreSQL source tree
cloned, built and installed so I can use it straight away and the ccache
is prewarmed).

cd openindiana
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
vagrant destroy

TODO:  Install civilised stuff like .vimrc, .screenrc
TODO:  Figure out how to set the git user/email without hardcoding it here
TODO:  Add a whole bunch more options (llvm, ssl, ...)
TODO:  Figure out how to move the number of CPUs and RAM size somewhere better.
TODO:  Add other providers (parallels, virtualbox, ...).
TODO:  Find some more OSes.
TODO:  Set up a full 32 bit library environment in eg Debian.
TODO:  Can this thing manage qemu-based emulation of ARM, POWER, RISC-V etc?
